        This package contains classes for a graphical user interface for the bn packages.
        It is partially designed using Netbeans, so the user interface code can be edited using
        the Netbeans built in GUI designer.
        
        The GUI requires the JGraphX library (v6 or later; https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx).
