#summary What you will find in this project

= Introduction =

bnkit is a collection of classes that aim to help implement a Bayesian network in Java. 
Currently it allows you to define a Bayesian network structure, use the network for inference,
and some learning from data.

The current version is very much a work-in-progress. 
It is a complete re-write of an earlier (in-house) version we have been using for research. 
So far only basic functionality has been moved across--so some attractive features are missing.
We also expect to extend the functionality and address efficiency concerns.

To generate documentation use javadoc. There are a few examples in the code and a very 
brief tutorial in the "bn" package documentation.

To compile the GUI, you need JGraphX (v.6 or later; https://github.com/jgraph/jgraphx).
