# Introduction

`bnkit` is a collection of classes that aim to help implement a Bayesian network in Java (at least version 8 is required).
Currently it allows you to define a Bayesian network structure, use the network for inference,
and some learning from data. It deals with missing values, both discrete and continuous variables.
There are reasonably efficient implementations of variable elimination, and expectation-maximisation
learning. `bnkit` does _not_ do structure learning.

The current version has been used for a number of studies now, but should still be regarded as work-in-progress.
It is a complete re-write of an earlier (in-house) version the Boden lab has been using for research since 2009 or so.

To generate documentation use javadoc. There are a few examples in the code and a very
brief tutorial in the `bn` package documentation.

# bnkit is part of [GRASP-suite](https://github.com/bodenlab/GRASP-suite)

As part of work funded by the Australian Research Council, the inference engine in bnkit has been bundled with code for phylogenetic analysis. In particular, the `asr` package interfaces with services for ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). GRASP (https://github.com/bodenlab/GRASP) implements a web server for ASR. The portal for everything around GRASP is [https://github.com/bodenlab/GRASP-suite](https://github.com/bodenlab/GRASP-suite).

In `bnkit` there is a command-line interface of GRASP `asr.GRASP`. This Java application can prove useful if you want to automate tasks, run reconstructions on your own dedicated hardware, and/or access the latest features. This version is essentially a command-line interface to the backend features of the web-based service. It is worth noting that the web-based version has the advantage of a visual user interface, but that also means that it may lack the latest functionality.

If you want to use `asr.GRASP`, go [here](https://bodenlab.github.io/GRASP-suite/project/graspcmd/) or download the [JAR file](https://bodenlab.github.io/GRASP-suite/project/graspcmd/archive/bnkit.jar).


## Configuring GRASP to run in IntelliJ
- Open Intellij
- Select File > New Project From Version Control
- Under URL add the URLÂ http://github.com/bodenlab/bnkit
- Under directory add where you want to save the project
- Under Run -> Edit Configurations
- Add New 'Application'
- Give it a name 'GRASP'
- And add 'asr.GRASP' as the main class
- Now you can run GRASP (green arrow / ctrl-R / Run > Run GRASP )
- You may need to upgrade your Java version / SDK in your settings
- If you want to add command line arguments, you can add these under Run > Edit Configurations and add them to the 'Program arguments' textbox

## Generate an external JAR using Maven
- Click on Maven (on the far right vertical bar)
- Click on bnkit > Lifecycle > package
- A jar will be created in the <directory>/target/bnkit-1.0.jar
